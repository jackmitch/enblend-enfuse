\section[Local Contrast Weighting]{Local Contrast Weighting
  \label{sec:local-contrast-weighting}
  \genidx{weighting!local contrast}}

Local contrast weighting favors pixels inside a high contrast
neighborhood.  The notion of ``high contrast'' is defined either by
two different criteria or by a blend of both:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The standard deviation (\acronym{SDev}) of all the pixels in the
  local analysis window is large.  See
  Section~\fullref{sec:standard-deviation}.

\item
  The Laplacian-of-Gaussian (\acronym{LoG}) has a large magnitude.
  See Section~\fullref{sec:laplacian-of-gaussian}.

\item
  If the \acronym{LoG} magnitude is below a given threshold, use
  \acronym{SDev} data, otherwise stick with \acronym{LoG}.  See
  Section~\fullref{sec:blend-sdev-and-log}.
\end{itemize}

\App{} converts every \acronym{RGB} image to grayscale before it
determines its contrast.
Option~\flexipageref{\option{--gray-projector}}{opt:gray-projector}
controls the projector function.  Depending on the subject, one of
several grayscale projectors may yield the best black-and-white
contrast for image fusion.

In the following sections we describe each algorithm in detail.


\subsection[Standard Deviation]{Standard Deviation
  \label{sec:standard-deviation}
  \genidx{weighting!contrast using standard deviation}
  \genidx{contrast weighting using standard deviation}}

The pixel under consideration~\textsf{C} sits exactly in the center of
a square, the so-called local analysis window. \genidx{local analysis
  window}\genidx{window!local-analysis} It always has an uneven edge
length.  The user sets the size with
option~\option{--contrast-window-size}.
Figure~\ref{fig:local-analysis-window} shows two windows with
different sizes.

  \caption[Local analysis window]{Examples of local analysis windows
    for the sizes~3 and~5.  ``\textsf{C}'' marks the center where the
    pixel gets the weight.  ``\textsf{N}'' denote neighboring pixels,
    which all contribute to the
    weight.\label{fig:local-analysis-window}}
\end{figure}


During the analysis, \App{} scans the local analysis window across all
rows and all columns\footnote{In the current implementation a
  \code{floor(contrast-window-size / 2)} wide border around the images
  remains unprocessed and gets a weight of zero.} of each of the input
images to compute the contrast weight of every pixel.

\subsubsection[Statistical Moments]{Statistical Moments
  \label{sec:statistical-moments}
  \genidx{statistical moments}}


We start with the probability function~$w$\genidx{probability
  function} of the random variable~$X$:\genidx{random variable}
\[
    w: x \rightarrow p(\{\omega: X(\omega) = x\}).
\]
\noindent It associates a probability~$p$ with each of the $n$
different possible outcomes~$\omega$ of the random variable~$X$.

Based on $w$, we define the expectation value\genidx{expectation
  value} or ``First Moment''\genidx{first moment}\genidx{moment!first}
of the random variable~$X$:
\[
    \Ex X := \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i w(x_i).
\]

Using the definition of the expectation value, we define the
variance\genidx{variance}, or ``Second Moment''\genidx{second
  moment}\genidx{moment!second} as
\[
    \Var X := \mbox{\Ex}\left( (X - \Ex X)^2 \right),
\]
\noindent and the standard deviation\genidx{standard deviation} as
\[
    \sigma \, X := \sqrt{\Var X}.
\]

Obviously, the variance of $X$ is the expectation value of the squared
deviation from the expectation value of $X$ itself.  Note that the
variance's dimension is $X$'s dimension squared; the standard
deviation rectifies the dimension to make it comparable with $X$
itself again.


\subsubsection[Estimators]{Estimators
  \label{sec:estimators}
  \genidx{estimators}}

In \App{}, we assume that $X$ follows a uniform probability
function~$w(x) = \mbox{const.}$  That is, all pixel values in the
local analysis window are considered to be equally probable.  Thus,
the expectation value and the variance can be estimated from the pixel
values like this
\[
    \mbox{\Ex } X := \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i.
\]
\noindent In other words: the expectation value is the arithmetic mean
of the lightness of all pixels in the local analysis window.
Analogously, the variance becomes
\[
    \mbox{\Var } X :=
    \frac{1}{n - 1} \, \mbox{\Ex}\left( (X - \mbox{\Ex } X)^2 \right).
\]


\subsection[Laplacian of Gaussian]{Laplacian of Gaussian
  \label{sec:laplacian-of-gaussian}
  \genidx{weighting!contrast using \propername{Laplacian}-of-\propername{Gaussian}}
  \genidx{contrast weighting using \propername{Laplacian}-of-\propername{Gaussian}}}

\begin{sloppypar}
  The \propername{Laplacian}-of-\propername{Gaussian}%
  \genidx{Laplacian-of-Gaussian@\propername{Laplacian}-of-\propername{Gaussian}}
  (\acronym{LoG}\gensee{Log@\acronym{LoG}}{\propername{Laplacian}-of-\propername{Gaussian}})
  is an operator to detect edges in an image.  Sometimes the
  \acronym{LoG}-operator is also called
  \propername{Marr}-\propername{Hildreth} operator.  A
  \propername{Laplacian}-of-\propername{Gaussian} operator,
  \uref{\hciiwrvigracommonfilters}{\code{vigra::laplacianOfGaussian}}
  is part of the package~\uref{\hciiwrvigra}{\acronym{VIGRA}} that
  \App{} is built upon and is used for edge detection if
  option~\option{--contrast-edge-scale} is non-zero and
  \option{--contrast-min-curvature} equal to or less than zero.
\end{sloppypar}

Let the Gaussian function be
\[
    g(x, y) =
    \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^2} \,
    {\exp\left(-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right)}
\]
\noindent The parameter~$\sigma$, the argument of
option~\option{--contrast-edge-scale}, is the length scale on which
edges are detected by $g(x, y)$.  We apply the \propername{Laplacian}
operator in \propername{Cartesian} coordinates
\[
    \bigtriangleup \equiv \nabla \cdot \nabla =
    \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}
\]
\noindent to $g(x, y)$, to arrive at a continuous representation of the
two-dimensional filter kernel
\[
    k(x, y) = \frac{\xi^2 - 1}{\pi \sigma^4} \exp(-\xi^2),
\]
\noindent where we have used the dimensionless distance~$\xi$ from the
origin
\[
    \xi^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \sigma^2}.
\]

\App{} uses a discrete approximation of $k$ in the convolution with
the image.  The operator is radially symmetric with respect to the
origin, which is why we can easily plot it in
Figure~\ref{fig:laplacian-of-gaussian}, setting $R = \sqrt{x^2 +
  y^2}$.

Sometimes the \acronym{LoG} is plagued by noise in the input images.
After all, it is a numerical approximation of the second derivative
and deriving always ``roughens'' a function.  The (normalized) mask
files relentlessly disclose such problems.  Use
option~\option{--contrast-min-curvature} with a \emph{negative}
argument~\metavar{CURVATURE} to suppress all edges with a curvature
below $-\metavar{CURVATURE}$ (which is a positive value).  Check the
effects with the mask files and particularly the hard-mask files
(\filename{\val{val:default-hard-mask-template}}) if using
option~\option{--hard-mask}.

To indicate the \metavar{CURVATURE} in relative terms, which is
particularly comprehensible for humans, append a percent sign
(\sample{\%}).  Try minimum curvatures starting from $-0.5\%$ to
$-3\%$.

\subsection[Blend \acronym{SDev} and \acronym{LoG}]%
{\label{sec:blend-sdev-and-log}\genidx{weighting!contrast using a
    blend of methods}\genidx{contrast weighting using a blend of
    methods}Blend Standard Deviation and
  \propername{Laplacian}\hyp{}of\hyp{}\propername{Gaussian}}

\App{} can team the standard deviation computation and Laplacian of
Gaussian to deliver the best of both methods.  Use a \emph{positive}
argument~\metavar{CURVATURE} with
option~\option{--contrast-min-curvature} to combine both algorithms.
In this mode of operation \App{} computes the \acronym{SDev}-weight
and the \acronym{LoG}-weight, then uses the \acronym{LoG} to decide
whether to go with that value or prefer the \acronym{SDev} data.  If
the \acronym{LoG} is greater than \metavar{CURVATURE} \App{} uses the
weight delivered by the \acronym{LoG}, otherwise the
\acronym{SDev}-weight is rescaled such that its maximum is equal to
\metavar{CURVATURE}, and the scaled \acronym{SDev} is used as weight.

This technique merges the two edge detection methods where they are
best.  The \acronym{LoG} excels with clear edges and cannot be fooled
by strong but smooth gradients.  However, it is bad at detecting faint
edges and it is susceptible to noise.  The \acronym{SDev} on the other
hand shines with even the most marginal edges, and resists noise quite
well.  Its weakness is that is is easily deceived by strong and smooth
gradients.  Tuning \metavar{CURVATURE} the user can pick the best
threshold for a given set of images.

\subsection[Scaling and Choice of Mode]{Scaling and Choice of Mode
  \genidx{scaling of parameters}
  \genidx{mode of operation (\acronym{SDev}, \acronym{LoG}, \dots)}}

Experience has shown that neither the parameters \metavar{EDGESCALE}
and \metavar{CURVATURE} nor the mode of operation
(\acronym{SDev}-only, \acronym{LoG}-only, or a blend of both) scales
to different image sizes.  In practice, this means that if you start
with a set of reduced size images, say $2808 \times 1872$~pixels,
carefully optimize \metavar{EDGESCALE}, \metavar{CURVATURE} and so on,
and find \acronym{LoG}-only the best mode, and then switch to the
original resolution of $5616 \times 3744$~pixels, multiplying (or
dividing) the parameters by four and sticking to \acronym{LoG}-only
might \emph{not} result in the best fused image.  For best quality,
perform the parameter optimization and the search for the most
appropriate mode at the final resolution.
