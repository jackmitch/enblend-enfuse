Enfuse
******

This manual is for Enfuse (version 4.0-dd32463fe9de, 5 November 2009),
a program to merge different exposures of the same scene to produce an
image that looks much like a tonemapped image.

1 Overview
**********

Enfuse merges overlapping images using the MERTENS-KAUTZ-VAN REETH
exposure fusion algorithm.(1)  This is a quick way for example to blend
differently exposed images into a nice output image, without producing
intermediate high-dynamic range (HDR) images that are then tonemapped
to a viewable image.  This simplified process often works much better
than tonemapping algorithms.

   Enfuse can also be used to build extended depth-of-field (DOF)
images by blending a focus stack.

   The idea is that pixels in the input images are weighted according to
qualities such as, for example, proper exposure, good local contrast,
or high saturation.  These weights determine how much a given pixel
will contribute to the final image.

   A BURT-ADELSON multiresolution spline blender(2) is used to combine
the images according to the weights.  The multiresolution blending
ensures that transitions between regions where different images
contribute are difficult to spot.

   Enfuse uses up to four criteria to judge the quality of a pixel,
which *note Table:weighting-criteria:: briefly describes.

Exposure
     The exposure criteria favors pixels with luminance close to the
     middle of the range.  These pixels are considered better exposed
     than those with high or low luminance levels.

Saturation
     The saturation criteria favors highly-saturated pixels.  (Note that
     saturation is only defined for color pixels.)

Local Contrast
     The contrast criteria favors pixels inside a high-contrast
     neighborhood.  Enfuse can use standard deviation, Laplacian
     magnitude, or a blend of both as local contrast measure.

Local Entropy
     The entropy criteria prefers pixels inside a high-entropy
     neighborhood.  In addition, Enfuse allows the user to mitigate the
     problem of noisy images when using entropy weighting by setting a
     black threshold.

Table 1.1: Enfuse's four weighting criteria.

   For the concept of pixel weighting, and details on the different
weighting functions, see *note Weighting Functions::.

   Adjust how much importance is given to each criterion by setting the
weight parameters on the command line.  For example, if you set
`--exposure-weight=1.0' and `--saturation-weight=0.5', Enfuse will
favor well-exposed pixels over highly-saturated pixels when blending
the source images.  The effect of these parameters on the final result
will not always be clear in advance.  The quality of the result is
subject to your artistic interpretation.  Playing with the weights may
or may not give a more pleasing result.  The authors encourage you to
experiment, perhaps using down-sized(3) or cropped images for speed.

   Enfuse expects but does not require each input image to have an alpha
channel.  By setting the alpha values of pixels to zero, users can
manually remove those pixels from consideration when blending.  If an
input image lacks an alpha channel, Enfuse will issue a warning and
continue assuming all pixels should contribute to the final output.
Any alpha value other than zero is interpreted as "this pixel should
contribute to the final image".

   Enfuse reads all layers of multi-layer images, like, for example,
multi-directory TIFF images(4).  The input images are processed in the
order they appear on the command line.  Multi-layer images are
processed from the first layer to the last before Enfuse considers the
next image on the command line.

   Find out more about Enfuse on its SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net/) web page (http://enblend.sourceforge.net/).

not desired to judge the image quality of the original-size image.
Cropping might be an alternative, though.

2 Workflow
**********

Enblend and Enfuse are parts of a chain of tools to assemble images.

   * Enblend combines a series of pictures taken at the same location
     but in different directions.

   * Enfuse merges photos of the same subject at the same location and
     same direction, but taken with varying exposure parameters.

*note Figure:photographic-workflow:: shows where Enblend and Enfuse sit
in this tool chain.

 Figure 2.1: Photographic workflow with Enblend and Enfuse.

Take Images
     Take _multiple_ images to form a panorama, an exposure series, a
     focus stack, etc.

          There is one exception with Enfuse when a single raw image is
          converted multiple times to get several - typically differently
          "exposed" - images.

     _Exemplary Benefits_
        * Many pictures taken from the same vantage point but showing
          different viewing directions.  - Panorama

        * Pictures of the same subject exposed with different shutter
          speeds.  - Exposure series

        * Images of the same subject focussed at differing distances.
          - Focus stack

     _Remaining Problem:_ The "overlayed" images may not fit together,
     that is the overlay regions may not match exactly.

Convert Images
     Convert the raw data
     (http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/understanding-series/u-raw-files.shtml)
     exploiting the full dynamic range of the camera and capitalize on
     a high-quality conversion.

Align Images
     Align the images so as to make them match as well as possible.

          Again there is one exception and this is when images naturally align.
          For example, a series of images taken from a rock solid tripod with a
          cable release without touching the camera, or images taken with a
          shift lens, can align without further user intervention.

     This step submits the images to affine transformations.  If
     necessary, it rectifies the lens' distortions (e.g. barrel or
     pincushion), too.  Sometimes even luminance or color differences
     between pairs of overlaying images are corrected ("photometric
     alignment").

     _Benefit:_ The overlay areas of images match as closely as
     possible given the quality if the input images and the lens model
     used in the transformation.

     _Remaining Problem:_ The images may still not align perfectly, for
     example, because of parallax
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax) errors, or blur produced
     by camera shake.

Combine Images
     Enblend and Enfuse combine the aligned images into one.

     _Benefit:_ The overlay areas become imperceptible for all but the
     most mal-aligned images.

     _Remaining Problem:_ Enblend and Enfuse write images with an alpha
     channel.  (For more information on alpha channels see *note
     Understanding Masks::.)  Furthermore, the final image rarely is
     rectangular.

Postprocess
     Postprocess the combined image with your favorite tool.  Often the
     user will want to crop the image and simultaneously throw away the
     alpha channel.

3 Invocation
************

`enfuse' [OPTIONS] [`--output='IMAGE] INPUT...

Fuse the sequence of images INPUT... into a single IMAGE.

   Input images are either specified literally or via so-called response
files.  A response file contains filenames of images or other response
filenames.  Introduce response file names with an at-character (`@').

   Enblend and Enfuse process the list INPUT... from left to right,
expanding response files depth-first.  The following examples only show
Enblend, but Enfuse works exactly the same.

Solely literal filenames.
     Example:
          enblend image-1.tif image-2.tif image-3.tif

     The ultimate order in which the images are processed is:
     `image-1.tif', `image-2.tif', `image-3.tif'.

Single response file.
     Example:
          enblend @list
     where file `list' contains
          img1.exr
          img2.exr
          img3.exr
          img4.exr

     Ultimate order: `img1.exr', `img2.exr', `img3.exr', `img4.exr'.

Mixed literal names and response files.
     Example:
          enblend @master.list image-09.png image-10.png
     where file `master.list' comprises of
          image-01.png
          @first.list
          image-04.png
          @second.list
          image-08.png
     `first.list' is
          image-02.png
          image-03.png
     and `second.list' contains
          image-05.png
          image-06.png
          image-07.png

     Ultimate order: `image-01.png', `image-02.png', `image-03.png',
     `image-04.png', `image-05.png', `image-06.png', `image-07.png',
     `image-08.png', `image-09.png', `image-10.png',


*Response File Format* Response files contain one filename per line.
Blank lines or lines beginning with a sharp sign (`#') are ignored.
Filenames that begin with an at-character (`@') denote other response
files.  *note Table:response-file-format:: states a formal grammar of
response files in EBNF (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebnf).

RESPONSE-FILE   ::=   LINE*
LINE            ::=   (COMMENT | FILE-SPEC) [`\r'] `\n'
COMMENT         ::=   SPACE* `#' TEXT
FILE-SPEC       ::=   SPACE* `@' FILENAME SPACE*
SPACE           ::=   ` ' | `\t'

where TEXT is an arbitrary string and FILENAME is any filename.

Table 3.1: EBNF definition of the grammar of response files.

   In a response file all relative filenames are used relative the the
response file itself, not relative to the current-working directory of
the application.

The above grammar might unpleasantly surprise the user in the some ways:

Literal filenames
     Inside a response file all filenames are treated as literals.  No
     filename globing or expansion is performed.  This is, the line
          img_*.tif
     stands for exactly one file called `img_*.tif'.

Whitespace trimmed at both line ends
     For convenience whitespace at the beginning and at the end of each
     line is ignored.  However, this implies that response files cannot
     represent filenames that start or end with whitespace, as there is
     no quoting syntax.  Filenames with embedded whitespace cause no
     problems, though.

Only whole-line comments
     Comments in response files always occupy a complete line.  There
     are no line-ending comments.  Thus in
          # exposure series
          img-0.33ev.tif # "middle" EV
          img-1.33ev.tif
          img+0.67ev.tif
     only the first line contains a comment, whereas the second lines
     includes none.  Rather it refers to
     file `img-0.33ev.tif # "middle" EV'.

Image filenames cannot start with `@'
     An at-sign always introduces a response file, even if the extension
     would hint towards an image.

   If Enblend or Enfuse do not recognize a response file, they will
issue a warning.  To force a file being recognized as a response file
add one of the following syntactic comments to the _first_ line of the
file.

     # response-file: true
     # enblend-response-file: true
     # enfuse-response-file: true

Here is an example of a valid response file.
     # 4\pi panorama!

     # These pictures were taken with the panorama head.
     @round-shots.list

     # Freehand sky shot.
     zenith.tif

     # "Legs, will you go away?" images.
     nadir-2.tif
     nadir-5.tif
     nadir.tif

3.1 Common Options
==================

Common options control some overall features of Enfuse.

`--compression=COMPRESSION'
     Write a compressed output file.

     Depending on the output file format, Enfuse accepts different
     values for COMPRESSION.

    JPEG
          COMPRESSION is a JPEG quality level ranging from 0-100.

    TIFF
          COMPRESSION is one of the keywords:

         `NONE'
               Do not compress.  This is the default.

         `DEFLATE'
               Use the DEFLATE compression scheme also called
               ZIP-in-TIFF.  DEFLATE is a lossless data compression
               algorithm that uses a combination of the LZ77 algorithm
               and HUFFMAN coding.

         `LZW'
               Use LEMPEL-ZIV-WELCH (LZW) adaptive compression scheme.
               LZW compression is lossless.

         `PACKBITS'
               Use PACKBITS compression scheme.  PACKBITS is a
               particular variant of run-length compression; it is
               lossless.

    Any other format
          Other formats do not accept a COMPRESSION setting.

          However, VIGRA (http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra/)
          automatically compresses `png'-files with the DEFLATE method.

`-h'
`--help'
     Print information on the available options then exit.

`-l LEVELS'
     Use at most this many LEVELS for pyramid (1) blending.

     The number of levels used in a pyramid controls the balance between
     local and global image features (contrast, saturation, ...) in the
     blended region.  Fewer levels emphasize local features and suppress
     global ones.  The more levels a pyramid has, the more global
     features will be taken into account.

     As a guideline, remember that each new level works on a linear
     scale twice as large as the previous level.  So, the zeroth layer,
     the original image, (obviously) defines the image at single-pixel
     scale, the first level works at two pixel scale, and generally, the
     n-th level contains image data at 2^n pixel scale.  This is the
     reason why an image of widthxheight pixels cannot be deconstructed
     into a pyramid of more than
          floor(log_2(min(width, height)))
     levels.

     If too few levels are used, "halos" around regions of high local
     contrast can show up.  On the other hand, if too many levels are
     used, the image might contain too much global contrast.  Usually,
     the latter is not a problem, but is highly desired.  This is the
     reason, why the default is to use as many levels as is possible
     given the size of the overlap regions.  Enfuse may still use a
     smaller number of levels if the geometry of the images demands.

     The valid range of LEVELS is 1 to 29.

`-o'
`--output=FILE'
     Place output in FILE.

     If `--output' is not specified, the default is to put the
     resulting image in `a.tif'.

`-v'
`--verbose[=LEVEL]'
     Without an argument, increase the verbosity of progress reporting.
     Giving more `--verbose' options will make Enfuse more verbose.
     Directly set a verbosity level with a non-negative integral LEVEL.

     Each level includes all messages of the lower levels.

    Level
          Messages

    0
          only warnings and errors

    1
          reading and writing of images

    2
          mask generation, pyramid, and blending

    3
          reading of response files, color conversions

    4
          image sizes, bounding boxes and intersection sizes

    5
          detailed information on the optimizer runs (Enblend only)

    6
          estimations of required memory in selected processing steps

     The default verbosity level of Enfuse is
     1.

`-V'
`--version'
     Output information on the Enfuse version.

     Team this option with `--verbose' to show configuration details,
     like the extra features that have been compiled in.

`-w'
`--wrap=MODE'
     Blend around the boundaries of the panorama.

     With this option, Enfuse treats the panorama of width w and
     height h as an infinite data structure, where each pixel P(x, y)
     of the input images represents the set of pixels S_P(x, y)(2).

     MODE takes the following values:

    `none'
    `open'
          This is a "no-op"; it has the same effect as not giving
          `--wrap' at all.  The set of input images is considered open
          at its boundaries.

    `horizontal'
          Wrap around horizontally:
               S_P(x, y) = {P(x + m * w, y): m in Z}.
          This is useful for 360o horizontal panoramas as it eliminates
          the left and right borders.

    `vertical'
          Wrap around vertically:
               S_P(x, y) = {P(x, y + n * h): m in Z}.
          This is useful for 360o vertical panoramas, as it eliminates
          the top and bottom borders.

    `both'
    `horizontal+vertical'
    `vertical+horizontal'
          Wrap around both horizontally and vertically:
               S_P(x, y) = {P(x + m * w, y + n * h): m, n in Z}.
          In this mode, both left and right borders, as well as top and
          bottom borders, are eliminated.

     Specifying `--wrap' without MODE selects horizontal wrapping.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

(http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/The_Tomb), actually, it is not a
pyramid: "Ziggaurat, it's a Ziggaurat
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggaurat).

   (2) Solid-state physicists will be reminded of the
`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born-von_Karman_boundary_condition',
BORN-VON KA'RMA'N boundary condition.

3.2 Extended Options
====================

Extended options control the image cache, the color model, and the
cropping of the output image.

`-b BLOCKSIZE'
     Set the BLOCKSIZE in kilobytes (KB) of Enfuse's image cache.

     This is the amount of data that Enfuse will move to and from the
     disk at one time.  The default is 2048KB, which should be ok for
     most systems.  See *note Tuning Memory Usage:: for details.

     Note that Enfuse must have been compiled with the image-cache
     feature for this option to be effective.  Find out about extra
     features with `enfuse --version --verbose'.

`-c'
     Use the CIECAM02 color appearance model for blending colors.

     The input files should have embedded ICC profiles when this option
     is specified.  If no ICC profile is present, Enfuse will assume
     that the image uses the sRGB color space.  The difference between
     this option and Enfuse's default color blending algorithm is
     slight, and will only be noticeable when areas of different
     primary colors are blended together.

`-d'
`--depth=DEPTH'
     Force the number of bits per channel and the numeric format of the
     output image.

     Enfuse always uses a smart way to change the channel depth, to
     assure highest image quality (at the expense of memory), whether
     requantization is implicit because of the output format or explicit
     with option `--depth'.

        * If the output-channel width is larger than the input-channel
          width of the input images, the input images' channels are
          widened to the output channel width immediately after
          loading, that is, as soon as possible.  Enfuse then performs
          all blending operations at the output-channel width, thereby
          preserving minute color details which can appear in the
          blending areas.

        * If the output-channel width is smaller than the input-channel
          width of the input images, the output image's channels are
          narrowed only right before it is written to disk, that is, as
          late as possible.  Thus the data benefits from the wider
          input channels for the longest time.

     All DEPTH specifications are valid in lowercase as well as
     uppercase letters.  For integer format use

    `8', `uint8'
          Unsigned 8bit; range: 0..255

    `int16'
          Signed 16bit; range: -32768..32767

    `16', `uint16'
          Unsigned 16bit; range: 0..65535

    `int32'
          Signed 32bit; range: -2147483648..2147483647

    `32', `uint32'
          Unsigned 32bit; range: 0..4294967295

     For floating-point format use

    `r32', `real32', `float'
          IEEE754 single precision floating-point, 32bit wide, 24bit
          significant
             * Minimal normalized value: 1.2*10^-38

             * Epsilon: 1.2*10^-7

             * Maximal finite value: 3.4*10^38

    `r64', `real64', `double'
          IEEE754 double precision floating-point, 64bit wide, 53bit
          significant
             * Minimal normalized value: 2.2*10^-308

             * Epsilon: 2.2*10^-16

             * Maximal finite value: 1.8*10^308

     If the requested DEPTH is not supported by the output file format,
     Enfuse warns and chooses the DEPTH that matches best.

     The OpenEXR data format is treated as IEEE754 float internally.
     Externally, on disk, OpenEXR data is represented by "half"
     precision floating-point numbers.

     OpenEXR (http://www.openexr.com/about.html#features) half
     precision floating-point, 16bit wide, 10bit significant
        * Minimum normalized value: 9.3*10^-10

        * Epsilon: 2.0*10^-3

        * Maximum finite value: 4.3*10^9

`-f WIDTHxHEIGHT'
`-f WIDTHxHEIGHT+xX-OFFSET+yY-OFFSET'
     Set the size of the output image manually to WIDTHxHEIGHT.
     Optionally specify the X-OFFSET and Y-OFFSET, too.

     This option is useful when the input images are cropped TIFF
     files, such as those produced by `nona'.  The stitcher `nona' is
     part of Hugin.  *Note Helpful Programs::.

`-g'
     Save alpha channel as "associated".  See the TIFF documentation
     (http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/tifftags/extrasamples.html)
     for an explanation.

     Gimp (before version 2.0) and CinePaint (*note Helpful Programs::)
     exhibit unusual behavior when loading images with unassociated
     alpha channels.  Use option `-g' to work around this problem.
     With this flag Enfuse will create the output image with the
     associated alpha tag set, even though the image is really
     unassociated alpha.

`-m CACHESIZE'
     Set the CACHESIZE in megabytes (MB) of Enfuse's image cache.

     This is the amount of memory Enfuse will use for storing image data
     before swapping to disk.  The default is
     1024MB, which is good for systems with 3-4gigabytes (GB) of RAM.
     See *note Tuning Memory Usage:: for details.

     Note that Enfuse must have been compiled with the image-cache
     feature for this option to be effective.  Find out about extra
     features with `enfuse --version --verbose'.

3.3 Fusion Options
==================

Fusion options define the proportion to which each input image's pixel
contributes to the output image.

`--contrast-weight=WEIGHT'
     (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--wContrast'.)

     Sets the relative WEIGHT of high local-contrast pixels.  Default:
     0.0.  Valid range: 0 <= WEIGHT <= 1.  See *note Local Contrast
     Weighting:: and *note Option contrast-window-size: Expert Options.

`--entropy-weight=WEIGHT'
     (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--wEntropy'.)

     Sets the relative WEIGHT of high local entropy pixels.  Default:
     0.0.  Valid range: 0 <= WEIGHT <= 1.  See *note Local Entropy
     Weighting:: and *note Options entropy-window-size and
     entropy-cutoff: Expert Options.

`--exposure-weight=WEIGHT'
     (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--wExposureMu'.)

     Sets the relative WEIGHT of the well-exposedness criterion.
     Increasing this weight relative to the others will make
     well-exposed pixels contribute more to the final output.  Default:
     1.0.  Valid range: 0 <= WEIGHT <= 1.  *Note Exposure Weighting::.

`--exposure-mu=MEAN'
     (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--wExposureMu'.)

     Set the MEAN (this is, the center) of the Gaussian exposure weight
     curve.  Default: 0.5.  Valid range: 0 <= MEAN <=
     1.

     Use this option to fine-tune exposure weighting (*note Exposure
     Weighting::).

`--exposure-sigma=STD-DEV'
     (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--wExposureSigma'.)

     Standard deviation STD-DEV of the Gaussian exposure weight curve.
     Default: 0.2.  Low numbers give less weight to pixels that are far
     from `--wMu' and vice versa.  Valid range:
     0 <= STD-DEV.

     Use this option to fine-tune exposure weighting (*note Exposure
     Weighting::).

`--saturation-weight=WEIGHT'
     (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--wSaturation'.)

     Sets the relative WEIGHT of high-saturation pixels.  Increasing
     this weight makes pixels with high saturation contribute more to
     the final output.  Default: 0.2.  Valid range:
     0 <= WEIGHT <= 1.  Saturation weighting is only defined for color
     images.  *Note Saturation Weighting::.

3.4 Expert Options
==================

Expert options influence the workings of Enfuse that require the user
to read the manual before applying them successfully.

`--contrast-window-size=SIZE'
     (This option supersedes the deprecated
     option `--ContrastWindowSize'.)

     Set the window SIZE for local contrast analysis.  The window will
     be a square of SIZExSIZE pixels.

     For contrast analysis SIZE values larger than 5 might result in a
     blurry composite image.  Values of 3 and 5 have given good results
     on focus stacks.

     Valid range: SIZE >= 3.

     If given an even SIZE, Enfuse will automatically use the next odd
     number.

     See also *note Option -contrast-weight: Fusion Options. and
     `--hard-mask' below.

`--contrast-edge-scale=EDGE-SCALE'
`--contrast-edge-scale=EDGE-SCALE:LCE-SCALE:LCE-FACTOR'
     (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--EdgeScale'.)

     A non-zero value for EDGE-SCALE switches on the
     Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) edge detection algorithm.  EDGE-SCALE
     is the radius of the Gaussian used in the search for edges.
     Default: 0.0pixels.

     A positive LCE-SCALE turns on local contrast enhancement (LCE)
     before the LoG edge detection.  LCE-SCALE is the radius of the
     Gaussian used in the enhancement step, LCE-FACTOR is the weight
     factor ("strength").
          enhanced =   (1 + LCE-FACTOR) * original
                     - LCE-FACTOR * GaussianSmooth(original, LCE-SCALE)

     LCE-SCALE defaults to 0.0 pixels and LCE-FACTOR defaults to
     0.0.  Append `%' to LCE-SCALE to specify the radius as a
     percentage of EDGE-SCALE.  Append `%' to LCE-FACTOR to specify the
     weight as a percentage.

`--entropy-cutoff=LOWER-CUTOFF'
`--entropy-cutoff=LOWER-CUTOFF:UPPER-CUTOFF'
     (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--EntropyCutoff'.)

     The first form defines the lower cutoff value below which pixels
     are treated as pure black when calculating the local entropy.  The
     second form also defines the upper cutoff value above which pixels
     are treated as pure white.

     For color images LOWER-CUTOFF and UPPER-CUTOFF are applied
     separately and independently to each channel.

     Defaults: 0% for LOWER-CUTOFF and 100% for UPPER-CUTOFF, that is,
     all pixels' values are taken into account.  Append a `%' to
     specify the cutoff relative to maximum pixel value in the source
     image (for example 255 or 65535).  *note Figure:entropy-cutoff::
     shows an example.

     Figure 3.1: Linear lightness Y in comparison with an
     entropy-cutoff function for LOWER-CUTOFF = 5% and UPPER-CUTOFF =
     90% which are rather extreme values.

        Note that a high LOWER-CUTOFF value lightens the resulting
     image, as dark (and presumably noisy) pixels are averaged with
     _equal_ weights.  With `--entropy-cutoff=0', the default, on the
     other hand, "noise" might be interpreted as high entropy and the
     noisy pixels get a high weight, which in turn renders the resulting
     image darker.  Analogously, a low UPPER-CUTOFF darkens the output
     image.

  `--entropy-window-size=SIZE'
        (This option supersedes the deprecated
     option `--EntropyWindowSize'.)

        Window SIZE for local entropy analysis.  The window will be a
     square of SIZExSIZE pixels.

        In the entropy calculation SIZE values of 3 to 7 yield an
     acceptable compromise of the locality of the information and the
     significance of the local entropy value itself.

        Valid range: SIZE >= 3.

        If given an even SIZE Enfuse will automatically use the next odd
     number.

  `--gray-projector=PROJECTOR'
        (This option supersedes the deprecated
     option `--GrayProjector'.)

        Use gray projector PROJECTOR for conversion of RGB images to
     grayscale masks: (R, G, B) -> Y.  In version 4.0-dd32463fe9de of
     Enfuse, the option is effective for exposure weighting and local
     contrast weighting.  Default: `average'.

        Valid values for PROJECTOR are:

    `average'
          Average red, green, and blue channel with equal weights.
          This is the default, and it often is a good projector for
          gamma = 1 data.
               Y = (R + G + B) / 3

    `channel-mixer:RED-WEIGHT:GREEN-WEIGHT:BLUE-WEIGHT'
          Weight the channels as given.
               Y = RED-WEIGHT * R + GREEN-WEIGHT * G + BLUE-WEIGHT * B

          The weights are automatically normalized to one, so
                   --gray-projector=channel-mixer:0.25:0.5:0.25
                   --gray-projector=channel-mixer:1:2:1
                   --gray-projector=channel-mixer:25:50:25
          all define the same mixer configuration.

          The three weights RED-WEIGHT, GREEN-WEIGHT, and BLUE-WEIGHT
          define the relative weight of the respective color channel.
          The sum of all weights is normalized to one.

    `l-star'
          Use the L-channel of the L*a*b*-conversion of the image as its
          grayscale representation.  This is a useful projector for
          gamma = 1 data.  It reveals minute contrast variations even
          in the shadows and the highlights.  This projector is
          computationally expensive.

          See Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space)
          for a detailed description of the Lab color space.

    `lightness'
          Compute the lightness of each RGB pixel as in an
          Hue-Saturation-Lightness (HSL) conversion of the image.
               Y = (max(R, G, B) + min(R, G, B)) / 2

    `luminance'
          Use the weighted average of the RGB pixel's channels as
          defined by CIE ("Commission Internationale de l'E'clairage")
          and the JPEG standard.
               Y = 0.30 * R + 0.59 * G + 0.11 * B

    `value'
          Take the Value-channel of the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV)
          conversion of the image.
               Y = max(R, G, B)

  `--hard-mask'
        (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--HardMask'.)

        Force hard blend masks on the finest scale.  This is the
     opposite flag of `--soft-mask'.

        This blending mode avoids averaging of fine details (only) at
     the expense of increasing the noise.  However it considerably
     improves the sharpness of focus stacks.  Blending with hard masks
     has only proven useful with focus stacks.

        See also *note Option -contrast-weight: Fusion Options. and
     `--contrast-window-size' above.

  `--contrast-min-curvature=CURVATURE'
        (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--MinCurvature'.)

        Define the minimum CURVATURE for the LoG edge detection.
     Default: 0.  Append a `%' to specify the minimum curvature
     relative to maximum pixel value in the source image (for example
     255 or 65535).

        A positive value makes Enfuse use the local contrast data
     (controlled with `--contrast-window-size') for curvatures less than
     CURVATURE and LoG data for values above it.

        A negative value truncates all curvatures less than -CURVATURE
     to zero.  Values above CURVATURE are left unchanged.  This
     effectively suppresses weak edges.

  `--save-masks'
  `--save-masks=SOFT-MASK-TEMPLATE'
  `--save-masks=SOFT-MASK-TEMPLATE:HARD-MASK-TEMPLATE'
        (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--SaveMasks'.)

        Save all weight files as TIFF images.  First form: Save all
     soft weight masks in files.  If option `--hard-mask' is effective
     also save the hard masks.  The defaults are
     `softmask-%n.tif' and `hardmask-%n.tif'.  In the second form,
     SOFT-MASK-TEMPLATE defines the names of the soft-mask files.  In
     the third form, HARD-MASK-TEMPLATE additionally defines the names
     of the hard-mask files.

        Both SOFT-MASK-TEMPLATE and HARD-MASK-TEMPLATE define templates
     that are expanded for each mask file.  In a template a percent
     sign (`%') introduces a variable part.  All other characters are
     copied literally.  Lowercase letters refer to the name of the
     respective input file, whereas uppercase ones refer to the name of
     the output file (*note Common Options::).  *note
     Table:mask-template-characters:: lists all variables.

        A fancy mask filename template could look like this:

          %D/soft-mask-%02n-%f.viff

        It puts the mask files into the same directory as the output
     file (`%D'), generates a two-digit index (`%02n') to keep the mask
     files nicely sorted, and decorates the mask filename with the name
     of the associated input file (`%f') for easy recognition.

  `--soft-mask'
        (This option supersedes the deprecated option `--SoftMask'.)

        Consider all masks when fusing.  This is the default.

`%%'
     Produces a literal `%'-sign.

`%i'
     Expands to the index of the mask file starting at zero.

     `%i' supports setting a pad character or a width specification:

          `%' PAD WIDTH `i'

     PAD is either `0' or any punctuation character; the default pad
     character is `0'.  WIDTH is an integer specifying the minimum
     width of the number.  The default is the smallest width given the
     number of input images, this is 1 for 2-9 images, 2 for 10-99
     images, 3 for 100-999 images, and so on.

     Examples: `%i', `%02i', or `%_4i'.

`%n'
     Expands to the number of the mask file starting at one.  Otherwise
     it behaves identically to `%i', including pad character and width
     specification.

`%p'
     This is the full name (path, filename, and extension) of the input
     file associated with the mask.

     Example: If the input file is called `/home/luser/snap/img.jpg',
     `%p' expands to `/home/luser/snap/img.jpg', or shorter: `%p' =>
     `/home/luser/snap/img.jpg'.

`%P'
     This is the full name of the output file.

`%d'
     Is replaced with the directory part of the associated input file.
     *note (coreutils.info)dirname::.

     Example (cont.): `%d' => `/home/luser/snap'.

`%D'
     Is replaced with the directory part of the output file.

`%b'
     Is replaced with the non-directory part (often called "basename")
     of the associated input file.  *note (coreutils.info)basename::.

     Example (cont.): `%b' => `img.jpg'.

`%B'
     Is replaced with the non-directory part of the output file.

`%f'
     Is replaced with the filename without path and extension of the
     associated input file.

     Example (cont.): `%f' => `img'.

`%F'
     Is replaced with the filename without path and extension of the
     output file.

`%e'
     Is replaced with the extension (including the leading dot) of the
     associated input file.

     Example (cont.): `%e' => `.jpg'.

`%E'
     Is replaced with the extension of the output file.

filenames.

3.5 Option Delimiters
=====================

Enfuse allows the arguments supplied to the program's options to be
separated by different separators.  The online documentation and this
manual, however, exclusively use the colon `:' in every syntax
definition and in all examples.

*Numeric Arguments*

   Valid delimiters are the the semicolon `;', the colon `:', and the
slash `/'.  All delimiters may be mixed within any option that takes
numeric arguments.

Examples:

`--contrast-edge-scale=0.667:6.67:3.5'
     Separate all arguments with colons.

`--contrast-edge-scale=0.667;6.67;3.5'
     Use semi-colons.

`--contrast-edge-scale=0.667;6.67/3.5'
     Mix semicolon and slash in weird ways.

`--entropy-cutoff=3%/99%'
     All delimiters also work in conjunction with percentages.

`--gray-projector=channel-mixer:3/6/1'
     Separate arguments with a colon and two slashes.

`--gray-projector=channel-mixer/30;60:10'
     Go wild and Enfuse will understand.

*Filename Arguments*

   Here, the accepted delimiters are `,', `;', and `:'.  Again, all
delimiters may be mixed within any option that has filename arguments.

Examples:

`--save-masks=soft-mask-%03i.tif:hard-mask-03%i.tif'
     Separate all arguments with colons.

`--save-masks=%d/soft-%n.tif,%d/hard-%n.tif'
     Use a comma.

4 Weighting Functions
*********************

As has been noted in the Overview (*note Overview::), Enfuse supports
four different types of weighting.  The following subsections describe
the concept of weighting and all weighting functions in detail.

4.1 Weighting Pixels
====================

Image fusion maps each pixel P(i, x, y) of every input image i to a
single pixel Q(x, y) in the output image:
     P(i, x, y) -> Q(x, y),
   where x runs from 1 to the common width of the images, y from 1 to
the common height, and i from 1 to the number of input images n.

   Enfuse allows for weighting the contribution of each P(i, x, y) to
the final Q(x, y):
     w(P(1, x, y)) * P(1, x, y) +
     ... +
     w(P(n, x, y)) * P(n, x, y)
     -> Q(x, y),                                                  (W)
   where

   * each w is non-negative to yield a physical intensity and

   * the sum of all w is one to leave the total intensity unchanged.

The pixel weights w themselves are weighted sums with the same
constraints
     w(P) = w_exp * f_exp(P) +
            w_sat * f_sat(P) +
            w_cont * f_cont(P, r_cont) +
            w_ent * f_ent(P, r_ent),
   where we have abbreviated P(i, x, y) to P for simplicity.  The user
defines the constants w_exp, w_sat, w_cont, and w_ent with the options
`--exposure-weight', `--saturation-weight', `--contrast-weight', and
`--entropy-weight'.  The functions f_exp, f_sat, f_cont, and f_ent
along with the window sizes r_cont and r_ent are explained in the next
sections.

4.1.1 Weighted Average
----------------------

By default, Enfuse uses a weighted average, where _each_ pixel
contributes as much as its weight demands.  Of course the weights can
be extreme, favoring only a few pixels or even only one pixel in the
input stack.  Extremes are not typical, however.

   Equal weights are another extreme that turns (W) into an arithmetic
average.  This is why we sometimes speak of the "averaging property" of
this weighting algorithm, like smoothing out noise.

4.1.2 Disabling Averaging: Option `--hard-mask'
-----------------------------------------------

The weighted average computation as described above has proven to be
widely successful with the exception of one special case: focus
stacking (*note Focus Stacks::), where the averaging noticeably softens
the final image.

   Use `--hard-mask' to switch Enfuse into a different ("Super
Trouper") weighting mode, where the pixel with the highest weight wins,
this is, gets weight one, and all other pixels get the weight of zero
("The Winner Takes It All.").  With `--hard-mask' Equation (W) becomes
     P(i, x, y) -> Q(x, y),
   where
     w(P(i, x, y)) >= w(P(j, x, y)) for all 1 <= j <= n.

Note that this "averaging" scheme lacks the nice noise-reduction
property of the weighted average (W), because only a single input pixel
contributes to the output.

4.2 Exposure Weighting
======================

Exposure weighting prefers pixels with a luminance Y close to the
center of the normalized, real-valued luminance interval [0, 1].

   RGB-pixels get converted to luminance using the grayscale projector
given by `--gray-projector', which defaults to `average'.  Grayscale
pixels are identified with luminance.

   In the normalized luminance interval 0.0 represents pure black and
1.0 represents pure white independently of the data type of the input
image.  This is, for a JPEG image the luminance 255 maps to 1.0 in the
normalized interval and for a 32bit TIFF picture the highest luminance
value 4294967295 also maps to 1.0.  The middle of the luminance
interval, 0.5, is where a neutral gray tone ends up with every camera
that had no exposure correction dialed in, for example the image of a
gray- or white-card.

   The exposure weighting algorithm only looks at a single pixel at a
time; the pixel's neighborhood is not taken into account.

   The weighting function is the Gaussian
     w_exp(Y) = exp(-0.5 * ((Y - Mu) / Sigma)^2),
   whose center Mu and width Sigma are controlled by the command line
options `--exposure-mu' and `--exposure-sigma' respectively.  Mu
defaults to 0.5 and Sigma defaults to 0.2.  *note Figure:gaussian::

   The options `--exposure-mu' and `--exposure-sigma' are for
fine-tuning the final result without changing the set of input images.
Option `--exposure-mu' sets the point MU of optimum exposure.
Increasing MU makes Enfuse prefer lighter pixels, rendering the final
image lighter, and vice versa.  Option `--exposure-sigma' defines the
range SIGMA of acceptable exposures.  Small values of SIGMA penalize
exposures that deviate from MU more, and vice versa.

4.3 Saturation Weighting
========================

Saturation weighting prefers pixels with a high saturation.

   Enfuse computes the saturation of a pixel according to the following
algorithm.

     MAX := maximum(R, G, B)
     MIN := minimum(R, G, B)
     if MAX = MIN then
         SATURATION := 0
     else
         SUM := MAX + MIN
         DIFFERENCE := MAX - MIN
         if SUM <= 1 then
             SATURATION := DIFFERENCE / SUM
         else
             SATURATION := DIFFERENCE / (2 - SUM)
         end if
     end if

Obviously, saturation weighting can only be defined for RGB images, not
for grayscale ones!  If you need something similar, check out *note
Local Entropy Weighting::; entropy weighting works for both RGB and
grayscale pictures.

   The saturation weighting algorithm only looks at a single pixel at a
time; the pixel's neighborhood is not taken into account.

4.4 Local Contrast Weighting
============================

Local contrast weighting favors pixels inside a high contrast
neighborhood.  The notion of "high contrast" is defined either by two
different criteria or by a blend of both:

   * The standard deviation (SDev) of all the pixels in the local
     analysis window is large.  *Note Standard Deviation::.

   * The Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) has a large magnitude.  *Note
     Laplacian of Gaussian::.

   * If the LoG magnitude is below a given threshold, use SDev data,
     otherwise stick with LoG.  *Note Blend SDev and LoG::.

   Enfuse converts every RGB image to grayscale before it determines
its contrast.  Option `--gray-projector' (*note Expert Options::)
controls the projector function.  Depending on the subject, one of
several grayscale projectors may yield the best black-and-white
contrast for image fusion.

   In the following sections we describe each algorithm in detail.

4.4.1 Standard Deviation
------------------------

The pixel under consideration C sits exactly in the center of a square,
the so-called "local analysis window".  It always has an uneven edge
length.  The user sets the size with option `--contrast-window-size'.
*note Figure:local-analysis-window:: shows two windows with different
sizes.

 Figure 4.2: Examples of local analysis windows for the sizes 3 and 5.
"C" marks the center where the pixel gets the weight.  "N" are
neighboring pixels, which all contribute equally to the weight.

   During the analysis, Enfuse scans the local analysis window across
all rows and all columns(1) of each of the input images to compute the
contrast weight of every pixel.

4.4.1.1 Statistical Moments
...........................

We start with the "probability function" w of the random variable X:
     w: x -> p({omega: X(omega) = x}).
   It associates a probability p with each of the n different possible
outcomes omega of the random variable X.  Based on w, we define the
"expectation value" or "First Moment" of the random variable X:
     Ex X := sum(x_i * w(x_i), i = 1..n).
   Using the definition of the expectation value, we define the
"variance", or "Second Moment" as
     Var X := Ex((X - Ex X)^2),
   and the "standard deviation" as
     Sdev X := sqrt(Var X).
   Obviously, the variance of X is the expectation value of the squared
deviation from the expectation value of X itself.  Note that the
variance's dimension is X's dimension squared; the standard deviation
rectifies the dimension to make it comparable with X itself again.

4.4.1.2 Estimators
..................

In Enfuse, we assume that X follows a uniform probability function w(x)
= const.  That is, all pixel values in the local analysis window are
considered to be equally probable.  Thus, the expectation value and the
variance can be estimated from the pixel values like this
     Ex X = sum(x_i, i = 1..n) / n.
   In other words: the expectation value is the arithmetic mean of the
lightness of all pixels in the local analysis window.  Analogously, the
variance becomes
     Var X = sum((x_i - Ex x)^2, i = 1..n) / (n - 1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In the current implementation a `floor(contrast-window-size /
2)' wide border around the images remains unprocessed and gets a weight
of zero.

4.4.2 Laplacian of Gaussian
---------------------------

The "Laplacian of Gaussian" (LoG) is an operator to detect edges in an
image.  Sometimes the LoG-operator is also called MARR-HILDRETH
operator.  A Laplacian-of-Gaussian operator,
`vigra::laplacianOfGaussian'
(http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra/doc/vigra/group__CommonConvolutionFilters.html)
is part of the package VIGRA (http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra/)
that Enfuse is built upon and is used for edge detection if
option `--contrast-edge-scale' is non-zero and
`--contrast-min-curvature' equal to or less than zero.

   Let the Gaussian function be
     g(x, y) = 1/pi * exp((x^2 + y^2) / (2 * sigma^2))/(2 * sigma^2)
   The parameter sigma, the argument of option `--contrast-edge-scale',
is the length scale on which edges are detected by g(x, y).  We apply
the Laplacian operator in Cartesian coordinates
     Delta := Nabla o Nabla = (d^2/dx^2 + d^2/dy^2)
   to g(x, y), to arrive at a continuous representation of the
two-dimensional filter kernel
     k(x, y) = (xi^2 - 1) * exp(-xi^2) / (pi * sigma^4),
   where we have used the dimensionless distance xi from the origin
     xi^2 = (x^2 + y^2) / (2 * sigma^2).
   Enfuse uses a discrete approximation of k in the convolution with
the image.  The operator is radially symmetric with respect to the
origin, which is why we can easily plot it in *note
Figure:laplacian-of-gaussian::, setting R = sqrt(x^2 + y^2).

   Sometimes the LoG is plagued by noise in the input images.  After
all, it is a numerical approximation of the second derivative and
deriving always "roughens" a function.  The (normalized) mask files
relentlessly disclose such problems.  Use
option `--contrast-min-curvature' with a _negative_ argument CURVATURE
to suppress all edges with a curvature below -CURVATURE (which is a
positive value).  Check the effects with the mask files and
particularly the hard-mask files (`hardmask-%n.tif') if using
option `--hard-mask'.

   To indicate the CURVATURE in relative terms, which is particularly
comprehensible for humans, append a percent sign (`%').  Try minimum
curvatures starting from -0.5% to -3%.

4.4.3 Blend Standard Deviation and Laplacian of Gaussian
--------------------------------------------------------

Enfuse can team the standard deviation computation and Laplacian of
Gaussian to deliver the best of both methods.  Use a _positive_
argument CURVATURE with option `--contrast-min-curvature' to combine
both algorithms.  In this mode of operation Enfuse computes the
SDev-weight and the LoG-weight, then uses the LoG to decide whether to
go with that value or prefer the SDev data.  If the LoG is greater than
CURVATURE Enfuse uses the weight delivered by the LoG, otherwise the
SDev-weight is rescaled such that its maximum is equal to CURVATURE,
and the scaled SDev is used as weight.

   This technique merges the two edge detection methods where they are
best.  The LoG excels with clear edges and cannot be fooled by strong
but smooth gradients.  However, it is bad at detecting faint edges and
it is susceptible to noise.  The SDev on the other hand shines with
even the most marginal edges, and resists noise quite well.  Its
weakness is that is is easily deceived by strong and smooth gradients.
Tuning CURVATURE the user can pick the best threshold for a given set
of images.

4.4.4 Scaling and Choice of Mode
--------------------------------

Experience has shown that neither the parameters EDGESCALE and
CURVATURE nor the mode of operation (SDev-only, LoG-only, or a blend of
both) scales to different image sizes.  In practice, this means that if
you start with a set of reduced size images, say 2808x1872 pixels,
carefully optimize EDGESCALE, CURVATURE and so on, and find LoG-only
the best mode, and then switch to the original resolution of 5616x3744
pixels, multiplying (or dividing) the parameters by four and sticking
to LoG-only might _not_ result in the best fused image.  For best
quality, perform the parameter optimization and the search for the most
appropriate mode at the final resolution.

4.5 Local Entropy Weighting
===========================

Entropy weighting prefers pixels inside a high entropy neighborhood.

   Let S be an n-ary source.  Watching the output of S an observer on
average gains the information
     H_a(n) := sum(p(x) * log_a(1 / p(x)), x in S)
   per emitted message, where we assume the knowledge of the probability
function p(S).  The expectation value H_a(n) is called "entropy" of the
source S.  Entropy measures our uncertainty if we are to guess which
message gets chosen by the source in the future.  The unit of the
entropy depends on the choice of the constant a > 1.  Obviously
     H_b(n) = H_a(n) / log_a(b)
   holds for all b > 1.  We use a = 2 for entropy weighting and set the
entropy of the "impossible message" to zero according to
     lim(p * log_a(1 / p), p -> 0) = 0.
   *note Figure:entropy:: shows an entropy function.

Figure 4.4: Entropy function H for an experiment with exactly two
outcomes.

   For more on (information) entropy visit Wikipedia
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_entropy).

   Enfuse computes a pixel's entropy by considering the pixel itself and
its surrounding pixels quite similar to *note Local Contrast
Weighting::.  The size of the window is set by `--entropy-window-size'.
Choosing the right size is difficult, because there is a serious
tradeoff between the locality of the data and the size of the sample
used to compute H.  A large window results in a large sample size and
therefore in a reliable entropy, but considering pixels far away from
the center degrades H into a non-local measure.  For small windows the
opposite holds true.

   Another difficulty arises from the use of entropy as a weighting
function in dark parts of an image, that is, in areas where the
signal-to-noise ratio is low.  Without any precautions, high noise is
taken to be high entropy, which might not be desired.  Use
option `--entropy-cutoff' to control the black level when computing the
entropy.

   On the other extreme side of lightness, very light parts of an image,
the sensor might already have overflown without the signal reaching 1.0
in the normalized luminance interval.  For these pixels the entropy is
zero and Enfuse can be told of the threshold by properly setting the
second argument of `--entropy-cutoff'.

5 Understanding Masks
*********************

A "binary mask" indicates for every pixel of an image if this pixel
must be considered in further processing, or ignored.  For a "weight
mask", the value of the mask determines how much the pixel contributes,
zero again meaning "no contribution".

   Masks arise in two places: as part of the input files and as separate
files, showing the actual pixel weights prior to image blendung or
fusion.  We shall explore both occurrences in the next sections.

5.1 Masks in Input Files
========================

Each of the input files for Enfuse and Enblend can contain its own
mask.  Both applications interpret them as binary masks no matter how
many bits per image pixel they contain.

   Use ImageMagick's `identify' or, for TIFF files, `tiffinfo' to
inquire quickly whether a file contains a mask.  *note Helpful
Programs:: shows where to find these programs on the web.

     $ identify -format "%f %m %wx%h %r %q-bit" remapped-0000.tif
     remapped-0000.tif TIFF 800x533 DirectClassRGBMatte 8-bit
                                                  ^^^^^ mask

     $ tiffinfo remapped-0000.tif
     TIFF Directory at offset 0x1a398a (1718666)
       Subfile Type: (0 = 0x0)
       Image Width: 800 Image Length: 533
       Resolution: 150, 150 pixels/inch
       Position: 0, 0
       Bits/Sample: 8
       Sample Format: unsigned integer
       Compression Scheme: PackBits
       Photometric Interpretation: RGB color
       Extra Samples: 1<unassoc-alpha>            <<<<< mask
       Orientation: row 0 top, col 0 lhs
       Samples/Pixel: 4                           <<<<< R, G, B, and mask
       Rows/Strip: 327
       Planar Configuration: single image plane

The "Matte" part of the image class and the "Extra Samples" line tell
us that the file features a mask.  Also, many interactive image
manipulation programs show the mask as a separate channel, sometimes
called "Alpha".  There, the white (high mask value) parts of the mask
enable pixels and black (low mask value) parts suppress them.

   The multitude of terms all describing the concept of a mask is
confusing.

Mask
     A mask defines a selection of pixels.  A value of zero represents
     an unselected pixel.  The maximum value ("white") represents a
     selected pixel and the values between zero and the maximum are
     partially selected pixels.  See Gimp-Savy
     (http://gimp-savvy.com/BOOK/index.html?node42.html).

Alpha Channel
     The alpha channel stores the transpacency value for each pixel,
     typically in the range from zero to one.  A value of zero means the
     pixel is completely transparent, thus does not contribute to the
     image.  A value of one on the other hand means the pixel is
     completely opaque.

Matte
     The notion "matte" as used by ImageMagick refers to an inverted
     alpha channel, more precisely: 1 - alpha.  See ImageMagick
     (http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/channels/#trans) for further
     explanations.

   Enblend and Enfuse only consider pixels that have an associated mask
value other than zero.  If an input image does not have an alpha
channel, Enblend warns and assumes a mask of all non-zero values, that
is, it will use every pixel of the input image for fusion.

   Stitchers like `nona' add a mask to their output images.

   Sometimes it is helpful to manually modify a mask before fusion.  For
example to suppress unwanted objects (insects and cars come into mind)
that moved across the scene during the exposures.  If the masks of all
input images are black at a certain position, the output image will
have a hole in that position.

5.2 Weight Mask Files
=====================

6 Tuning Memory Usage
*********************

The default configuration of Enblend and Enfuse assumes a system with
3-4GB of RAM.

   If Enblend and Enfuse have been compiled with the "image-cache"
feature, they do not rely on the operating system's memory management,
but use their own image cache in the file system.  To find out whether
your version uses the image cache say

     enblend --verbose --version

or

     enfuse --verbose --version

Enblend and Enfuse put the file that holds the image cache either in
the directory pointed to by the environment variable `TMPDIR', or, if
the variable is not set, in directory `/tmp'.  It is prudent to ensure
write permissions and enough of free space on the volume with the cache
file.

   The size of the image cache is user configurable with the option `-m
CACHE-SIZE' (*note Extended Options::).  Furthermore, option `-b
BUFFER-SIZE' (*note Extended Options::) allows for fine-tuning the size
of a single buffer inside the image cache.  Note that CACHE-SIZE is
given in megabytes, whereas the unit of BUFFER-SIZE is kilobytes.

   Usually the user lets the operating system take care of the memory
management of all processes.  However, users of Enblend or Enfuse might
want to control the balance between the operating systems' Virtual
Memory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory) system and the
image cache for several reasons.

   * Paging in or out parts of a process' image runs at kernel level and
     thus can make user processes appear unresponsive or "jumpy".  The
     caching mechanism of Enblend and Enfuse of course runs as a user
     process, which is why it has less detrimental effects on the
     system's overall responsiveness.

   * The image cache has been optimized for accesses to image data.  All
     algorithms in Enblend and Enfuse have been carefully arranged to
     play nice with the image cache.  An operating system's cache has no
     knowledge of these particular memory access patterns.

   * The disk access of the operating system to the swap device has been
     highly optimized.  Enblend and Enfuse on the other hand use the
     standard IO-layer, which is a much slower interface.

   * Limiting the amount of image cache prevents Enblend and Enfuse from
     eating up most or all RAM, thereby forcing all user applications
     into the swap.

The CACHE-SIZE should be set in such a way as to reconcile all of the
above aspects even for the biggest data sets, that is, projects with
many large images.

   *note Table:cache-size-settings:: suggests some cache- and
buffer-sizes for different amounts of available RAM.

      RAM  | CACHE-SIZE | BUFFER-SIZE | Comment
      MB   |     MB     |     KB      |
     ------+------------+-------------+---------
      4096 | 1024       | 2048        | default
      2048 | 512--1024  | 1024        |
      1024 | 256--512   | 256--512    |

Table 6.1: Suggested cache-size settings

   On systems with considerably more than 4GB of RAM it is recommended
to run Enblend or Enfuse versions without image cache.

7 Applications of Enfuse
************************

This section describes some of the novel possibilities that Enfuse
offers the photographer.  In contrast to the previous chapters, it
centers around the image effects.

7.1 What Makes Images Fusable?
==============================

Images should align well to be suitable for fusion.  However, there is
no hard mathematical rule what "well" means.  The alignment
requirements for 16MPixel images to yield a sharp 4"x6" print at 300dpi
("dpi" means dots per inch) or even for web presentation are relatively
low, whereas the alignment of 8MPixel images for a 12"x18" print ought
to be tight.

   If the input images need to be aligned, Hugin (*note Helpful
Programs::) is the tool of choice.  It produces images exactly in the
format that Enfuse expects.

   Sometimes images naturally align extremely well so that no
re-alignment is required.  An image series with preprogrammed exposure
steps taken in rapid succession where the camera is mounted on a heavy
tripod and a humongous ball head, mirror lockup, and a cable release
are used, comes to mind.

   When in doubt about what will work, try it, and judge for yourself.

Useful ideas for a good alignment:

   * Fix all camera parameters that are not explicitly varied.

    _Aperture_
          Engage full manual (<M>) or aperture-priority (<A>) mode.

    _Auto-focus_
          Disable "Auto Focus".  Be aware that the auto-focus function
          could be linked to shutter-release button position "half
          pressed" or to the shutter release in insidious ways.

    _Closed eyepiece_
          (This applies only to single lens reflex cameras.) Close the
          eyepiece when using a cable release to suppress variations in
          stray light.

    _Exposure time/Shutter speed_
          Use the shortest possible exposure time or, in other words,
          use the fastest shutter speed to avoid blur caused by camera
          shake or motion blur.

    _Flash power_
          Explicitly control the flash power of _all_ flashes.  This is
          sometimes called "flash exposure lock".

    _Sensitivity_
          Disable "Auto ISO".

    _White balance_
          Disable "Auto White Balance".  Instead, use the most suitable
          fixed white balance or take the white balance off a white
          card.  When in doubt, use the setting "Daylight" or
          equivalent.

   * Steady the camera by any means.

        * Apply your best camera bracing technique combined with
          controlled breathing.

        * Prefer a monopod, or better, a rigid tripod with a heavy head.

        * Use a cable release if possible.

        * (This applies to cameras with a moving mirror only.)  Engage
          "mirror lockup".

        * Consider automatic bracketing when applicable.

        * Activate camera- or lens-based image stabilization if you are
          sure that it improves the image quality in your particular
          case; otherwise disengage the feature.

          For some lens-based image stabilization systems, it is known
          that they "lock" into different positions every time they are
          activated.  Moreover, some stabilization systems decrease the
          image quality when the lens is mounted on a tripod.

   * Fire in rapid succession.

7.2 Repetition - Noise Reduction
================================

*Main Purpose*:  Reduce noise

With the default settings, Enfuse computes a weighted average of the
input pixels.  For a series of images, repeated with identical
settings, this results in a reduction of (photon shot) noise.  In other
words, the dynamic range increases slightly, because the higher
signal-to-noise ratio makes darker shades usable.  Furthermore, smooth
or glossy surfaces get a "cleaner" look, and edges become visually
sharper.  The nitty-gritty reportage look that sometimes stems from a
high sensitivity setting disappears.

   Averaged images, and therefore low-noise images, are the base for a
multitude of techniques like, for example, differences.  The most
prominent method in this class is dark-frame subtraction.

   The defaults set `--exposure-weight=1.0' and
`--saturation-weight=0.2'.  Eliminating the saturation component with
`--saturation-weight=0.0' can be worth an extra run.

7.3 Exposure Series - Dynamic Range Increase
============================================

*Main Purpose*:  Increase manageable dynamic range

An exposure series is a set of images taken with identical parameters
except for the exposure time.  Some cameras even provide special
functions to automate recording exposure series.  See the instruction
manual of your model for details.

   Enfuse's defaults, `--exposure-weight=1.0' and
`--saturation-weight=0.2' are well suited for fusion of _color_ images.
Remember that saturation weighting only works for RGB data.
Option `--saturation-weight' helps to control burnt-out highlights, as
these are heavily desaturated.  If no image suffers from troublesome
highlights, the relative saturation weight can be reduced and even be
set to zero.  For black and white images `--entropy-weight' can be an
alternative to `--saturation-weight' because it suppresses overexposed
pixels, as these contain little information.  However, entropy
weighting is not limited to grayscale data; it has been successfully
applied to RGB images, too.  Note that saturation weighting considers
_each_ color channel of an RGB image separately and chooses the channel
with the minimum entropy as representative for the whole pixel.

   Enfuse offers the photographer tremendous flexibility in fusing
differently exposed images.  Whether you combine only two pictures or a
series of 21, Enfuse imposes no limits on you.  Accordingly, the
photographic effects achieved range from subtle to surreal, like the
late 1980s "Max Headroom" TV-Series, to really unreal.  Like some time
ago in the chemical days of photography, when a new developer opened
unseen possibilities for artists, exposure fusion extends a
photographer's expressive space in the digital age.  Whether the
results look good or bad, whether the images are dull or exciting, is
entirely up the artist.

   In the next sections we give assistance to starters, and rectify
several misconceptions about Enfuse.

7.3.1 Tips For Beginners
------------------------

Here are some tips to get you in business quickly.

_Include the best single exposure._
     Include the exposure you would have taken if you did not use
     Enfuse in your series.  It gives you a solid starting point.
     Think of the other images as augmenting this best single exposure
     to bring out the light and dark features you would like to see.

_Begin with as small a number of images as possible._
     Pre-visualizing the results of Enfuse is difficult.  The more
     images put into the fusion process and the wider their EV-spacing
     is, the more challenging visualizing the output image becomes.
     Therefore, start off with as few images as possible.

     You can take a larger series of images and only use part of it.

_Start with a moderate EV-spacing._
     As has been pointed out in the previous item, a wide EV-spacing
     makes pre-visualization harder.  So start out with a spacing of
     2/3EV to 1+1/3EV.

7.3.2 Common Misconceptions
---------------------------

Here are some surprisingly common misconceptions about exposure series.

_A single image cannot be the source of an exposure series._
     Raw-files in particular lend themselves to be converted multiple
     times and the results being fused together.  The technique is
     simpler, faster, and usually even looks better than digital
     blending
     (http://luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/digital-blending.shtml)
     (as opposed to using a graduated neutral density filter) or
     blending exposures
     (http://www.gimpguru.org/Tutorials/BlendingExposures/) in an image
     manipulation program.  Moreover, perfect alignment comes free of
     charge!

_An exposure series must feature symmetrically-spaced exposures._
     Twice wrong!  Neither do the exposures have to be "symmetric" like
     {0EV, -2/3EV, +2/3EV}, nor does the number of exposures have to be
     odd.  Series like {-1-1/3EV, -1/3EV, +1/3EV} or {-1EV, 1EV} might
     be just right.  By the way, the order in which the images were
     taken does not matter either.

_An exposure series must cover the whole dynamic range of the scene._
     If you do not want to cover the whole range, you do not have to.
     Some HDR programs require the user to take a light probe,(1)
     whereas Enfuse offers the user complete freedom of exposure.

_All exposure values must be different._
     You can repeat any exposure as often as you like.  That way you
     combine an exposure series with parts of *note Repetition::,
     emphasizing the multiply occuring exposures and reducing noise.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Paul E. Debevec (http://www.debevec.org/) defines: "A "light
probe" image is an omnidirectional, high dynamic range image that
records the incident illumination conditions at a particular point in
space."

7.4 Flash Exposure Series - Directed Lighting
=============================================

*Main Purpose*:  ???

...

7.5 Polarization Series - Saturation Enhancement
================================================

*Main Purpose*:  Reflection suppression, saturation enhancement

In the current implementation of Enfuse, it is not possible in general
to fuse a polarization series.  Nai"vely abusing `--saturation-weight'
will not work.

7.6 Focus Stacks - Depth-of-Field Increase
==========================================

*Main Purpose*:  Synthetic Depth-of-Field Increase

A "focus stack" is a series of images where the distance of the focal
plane from the sensor varies.  Sloppily speaking, the images were
focussed at different distances.  Fusing such a stack increases the
depth-of-field (DOF) beyond the physical limits of diffraction.

7.6.1 Why create focus stacks?
------------------------------

Given

   * a fixed sensor or film size,

   * a lens' particular focal length, and

   * a notion about "sharpness", technically speaking the size of the
     circle-of-confusion (CoC)

the photographer controls the depth-of-field with the aperture.
Smaller apertures - this is larger aperture numbers - increase the DOF
and vice versa.  However, smaller apertures increase diffraction which
in turn renders the image unsharp.  So, there is an optimum aperture
where the photographer gets maximum DOF.  Sadly, for some purposes like
macro shots it is not enough.  One way out is to combine the sharp
parts of images focused at different distances, thereby artificially
increasing the total DOF.  This is exactly what Enfuse can do.

   All lenses have a so called "sweet spot" aperture, where their
resolution is best.  Taking pictures at this aperture, the photographer
squeezes the maximum quality out of the lens.  But: the "sweet spot"
aperture often is only one or two stops away from wide open.  Wouldn't
it be great to be able combine these best-possible images to form one
high-quality, sufficient-DOF image?  Welcome to Enfuse's local-contrast
selection abilities.

7.6.2 Preparing Focus Stacks
----------------------------

We are going to combine images with limited DOF to increase their
in-focus parts.  The whole process is about image sharpness.
Therefore, the input images must align very well, not just well, but
very well.  For optimum results the maximum control point distance in
Hugin (*note Helpful Programs::) should not exceed 0.3-0.5pixels to
ensure perfect blending.

   As in all image fusion operations it is preferable to use 16bit
linear (gamma = 1) images throughout, but 8bit gamma encoded images
will do.  Naturally, high SNR input data always is welcome.

7.6.3 Local Contrast Based Fusing
---------------------------------

A bare bones call to Enfuse for focus stacking could look like this.

     enfuse \
         --exposure-weight=0 \
         --saturation-weight=0 \
         --contrast-weight=1 \
         --hard-mask \
         ... \
         --output=output.tif \
         input-<0000-9999>.tif

Here is what each option causes:

`--exposure-weight=0'
     Switch *off* exposure based pixel selection.  The default weight
     is 1.0.

`--saturation-weight=0'
     Switch *off* saturation based pixel selection.  The default weight
     is 0.2.

`--contrast-weight=1'
     Switch *on* pixel selection based on local contrast.

`--hard-mask'
     Select the best pixel from the image stack and ignore all others.
     Without this option, Enfuse uses all pixels in the stack and
     weights them according to their respective quality, which in our
     case is local contrast.  Without `--hard-mask', the result will
     always look a bit soft.  *Note Local Contrast Weighting::.

If you want to see some entertaining progress messages - local-contrast
weighting takes a while -, also pass the `--verbose' option for a
verbose progress report.

7.6.4 Basic Focus Stacking
--------------------------

For a large class of image stacks Enfuse's default algorithm, as
selected in *note Local Contrast Based Fusing::, to determine the
sharpness produces nice results.  The algorithm uses a moving square
window, the so-called contrast window.  It computes the standard
deviation of the pixels inside of the window.  The program then selects
the window's center pixel of the image in the stack where the standard
deviation is largest, that is, the local contrast reaches the maximum.

   However, the algorithm fails to deliver good masks for images which
exhibit high contrast edges on the scale of the contrast window size.
The typical artifacts that show up are

   * faint dark seams on the light side of the high contrast edges and

   * extremely soft, slightly lighter seams on the dark side of the high
     contrast edges,

where the distance of the seams from the middle of the edge is
comparable to the contrast window size.

   If your results do not show any of these artifacts, stick with the
basic algorithm.  Advanced focus stacking, as described in the next
sections, delivers superior results in case of artifacts, though
requires manually tuning several parameters.

7.6.5 Advanced Focus Stacking
-----------------------------

If your fused image shows any of the defects described in the previous
section, you can try a more difficult-to-use algorithm that effectively
works around the seam artifacts.  It is described in the next section.

7.6.5.1 A Detailed Look at the Problem
......................................

Let us use an example to illustrate the problem of relating the
sharpness with the local contrast variations.  Say we use a 5x5
contrast window.  Moreover, let `sharp_edge' and `smooth_edge' be two
specific configurations:

     sharp_edge =  [    0,    0,  200,    0,    0;
                        0,  225,    0,    0,    0;
                        0,  255,    0,    0,    0;
                      215,    0,    0,    0,    0;
                      200,    0,    0,    0,    0]

     smooth_edge = [    0,   62,  125,  187,  250;
                        1,   63,  126,  188,  251;
                        2,   65,  127,  190,  252;
                        3,   66,  128,  191,  253;
                        5,   67,  130,  192,  255]

   where `;' separates the rows and `,' separates the columns.  This is
in fact Octave (http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) syntax.

   Images *note Figure:sharp-edge:: and *note Figure:smooth-edge:: show
plots of the matrices `sharp_edge' and `smooth_edge'.

Figure 7.2: 3D plot augmented by contour plot of the matrix
`smooth_edge'.

Our intuition lets us "see" an extremely sharp edge in the first
matrix, whereas the second one describes an extraordinarily smooth
diagonal intensity ramp.  Which one will be selected?  Well,
`sharp_edge' has a standard deviation of 88.07 and `smooth_edge' has
88.41.  Thus, `smooth_edge' wins, contradicting our intuition, and even
worse, our intention!

   Sadly, configurations like `smooth_edge' occur more often with
high-quality, good bokeh
(http://www.luminous-landscape.com/essays/bokeh.shtml) lenses.  In
fact, they are the very manifestation of "good bokeh".  Therefore,
Laplacian edge detection plays an important role when working with
high-quality lenses.

7.6.5.2 Laplacian Edge Detection
................................

Enfuse provides a Laplacian-based algorithm that can help in situations
where weighting based on the standard deviation fails.  It is activated
with a positive value for SCALE in `--contrast-edge-scale'=SCALE.  The
Laplacian will detect two-dimensional _curvature_ on the scale of
SCALE.  Here and in the following we simply speak of "curvature" where
we mean "magnitude of curvature".  That is, we shall not distinguish
between convex and concave edges.  Enfuse always use the magnitude of
curvature for weighting.

   Typically, SCALE ranges between 0.1pixels and 0.5pixels, where
0.3pixels is a good starting point.  To find the best value for SCALE
though, usually some experimentation will be necessary.  Use
`--save-masks' to get all soft-mask (default:
`softmask-%n.tif') and hard-mask files (default:
`hardmask-%n.tif').  Check how different scales affect the artifacts.
Also *note Understanding Masks::.

7.6.5.3 Local Contrast Enhancement
..................................

Sometimes Enfuse misses smoother edges with `--contrast-edge-scale' and
a little local contrast enhancement (LCE) helps.  Set
`--contrast-edge-scale'=SCALE:LCE-SCALE:LCE-FACTOR.  where LCE-SCALE
and LCE-FACTOR work like the unsharp mask
(http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/unsharp-mask.htm) filters
in various image manipulation programs.  Start with LCE-SCALE ten times
the value of SCALE and a LCE-FACTOR of 2-5.

   LCE-SCALE can be specified as a percentage of SCALE.  LCE-FACTOR
also can be specified as a percentage.  Examples:

     --contrast-edge-scale=0.3:3.0:3
     --contrast-edge-scale=0.3:1000%:3.0
     --contrast-edge-scale=0.3:3:300%
     --contrast-edge-scale=0.3:1000%:300%

By default LCE is turned off.

7.6.5.4 Suppressing Noise or Recognizing Faint Edges
....................................................

The Laplacian-based algorithm is much better at resisting the seam
problem than the local-contrast algorithm, but it has two shortcomings:

  1. The Laplacian is very susceptible to noise and

  2. it fails to recognize faint edges.

The `--contrast-min-curvature' option helps to mitigate both flaws.

   The argument to `--contrast-min-curvature'=CURVATURE either is an
absolute lightness value, for example 0..255 for 8bit data and 0..65535
for 16bit data, or, when given with a `%'-sign it is a relative
lightness value ranging from 0% to 100%.

   To suppress unreal edges or counter excessive noise, use the
`--contrast-min-curvature' option with a _negative_ curvature measure
CURVATURE.  This forces all curvatures less than -CURVATURE to zero.

   A _positive_ curvature measure CURVATURE makes Enfuse merge the LoG
data with the local-contrast data.  Every curvature larger than or
equal to CURVATURE is left unchanged, and every curvature less than
CURVATURE gets replaced with the rescaled local-contrast data, such
that the largest local contrast is just below CURVATURE.  This combines
the best parts of both techniques and ensures a precise edge detection
over the whole range of edge curvatures.

*Summary*

`--contrast-edge-scale=0.3'
     Use LoG to detect edges on a scale of 0.3pixels.  Apply the
     default grayscale projector: `average'.

`--contrast-edge-scale=0.3 --gray-projector=l-star'
     Use LoG to detect edges on a scale of 0.3pixels.  Apply the
     L*-grayscale projector.

`--contrast-edge-scale=0.3:3:300%'
     Use LoG to detect edges on a scale of 0.3pixels, pre-sharpen the
     input images by 300% on a scale of 3pixels.  Apply the default
     grayscale projector: `average'.

`--contrast-edge-scale=0.3 --contrast-min-curvature=-0.5%'
     Use LoG to detect edges on a scale of 0.3pixels.  Apply the
     default grayscale projector: `average' and throw away all edges
     with a curvature of less than 0.5%.

`--contrast-edge-scale=0.3 --contrast-min-curvature=0.5% --contrast-window-size=7'
     Use LoG to detect edges on a scale of 0.3pixels.  Apply the
     default grayscale projector: `average' and throw away all edges
     with a curvature of less than 0.5% and replace the LoG data
     between 0% and 0.5% with SDev data.  Use a window of 7x7pixel
     window to compute the SDev.

7.6.5.5 Focus Stacking Decision Tree
....................................

Figure *note Figure:focus-stacking-decision-tree:: helps the user to
arrive at a well-fused focus stack with as few steps as possible.

 Figure 7.3: Focus stacking decision tree.

   Always start with the default, contrast weighting with a local
contrast window.  Only if seams appear as described in *note Advanced
Focus Stacking:: switch to Laplacian-of-Gaussian contrast detection.

   If some seams remain even in LoG-mode, decrease the sensitivity of
the edge detection with a positive `--contrast-min-curvature'.  A too
high value of `--contrast-min-curvature' suppresses fine detail though.
Part of the detail can be brought back with pre-sharpening, that is,
*note Local Contrast Enhancement:: or combining LoG with
local-contrast-window mode by using a negative
`--contrast-min-curvature'.

   Carefully examining the masks (option `--save-masks') that Enfuse
uses helps to judge the effects of the parameters.

7.6.6 Tips For Focus Stacking Experts
-------------------------------------

We have collected some advice with which even focus-stacking adepts can
benefit.

   * Ensure that the sensor is clean.

     Aligning focus stacks requires varying the viewing angle, which
     corresponds to a changing focal length.  Hence, the same pixel on
     the sensor gets mapped onto different positions in the final
     image.  Dirt spots will occur not only once but as many times as
     there are images in the stack - something that is no fun to
     correct in postprocessing.

     Along the same lines, the photographer may want to consider to
     prepare dark frames before, and possibly also after, the shoot of
     the focus stack, to subtract hot pixels before fusion.

   * Prefer a low-sensitivity setting ("ISO") on the camera to get
     low-noise images.

     Fusing with `--hard-mask' does not average, and thus does not
     suppress any noise in the input images.

   * If the transition of in-focus to out-of-focus areas is too abrupt,
     record the images with closest and farthest focusing distances
     twice: first with the intended working aperture, and a second time
     with a small aperture (large aperture number).

     The small aperture will give the fused image a more natural
     in-focus to out-of-focus transition and the working-aperture shots
     supply the detail in the in-focus regions.

8 Helpful Additional Programs
*****************************

Several programs and libraries have proven helpful when working with
Enfuse and Enblend.

*Raw Image Conversion*
        * DCRaw (http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/) is a
          universal raw-converter written by DAVID COFFIN.

        * UFRaw (http://ufraw.sourceforge.net/), a raw converter written
          by UDI FUCHS and based on DCRaw, adds a GUI (`ufraw'),
          versatile batch processing (`ufraw-batch'), and some
          additional features such as cropping, noise reduction with
          wavelets, and automatic lens error correction.

*Image Alignment and Rendering*
        * ALE (http://auricle.dyndns.org/ALE/), DAVID HILVERT'S
          anti-lamenessing engine for the real die-hard command-line
          users aligns, filters, and renders images.

        * Hugin (http://hugin.sourceforge.net/) is a GUI that aligns
          and stitches images.

          It comes with several command line tools, like `nona' to
          stitch panorama images, `align_image_stack' to align
          overlapping images for HDR or create focus stacks, and
          `fulla' to correct lens errors.

        * PanoTools (http://panotools.sourceforge.net/) the successor of
          HELMUT DERSCH'S original PanoTools
          (http://www.all-in-one.ee/~dersch/) offers a set of
          command-line driven applications to create panoramas.  Most
          notable are `PTOptimizer' and `PTmender'.

*Image Manipulation*
        * CinePaint (http://www.cinepaint.org/) is a branch of an early
          Gimp forked off at version 1.0.4.  It sports much less
          features than the current Gimp, but offers 8bit, 16bit and
          32bit color channels, HDR (for example floating-point TIFF,
          and OpenEXR), and a tightly integrated color management
          system.

        * The Gimp (http://www.gimp.org/) is a general purpose image
          manipulation program.  At the time of this writing it is
          still limited to images with only 8bits per channel.

        * ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/) and its clone
          GraphicsMagick (http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) are general
          purpose command-line driven image manipulation programs, for
          example, `convert', `display', `identify', and `montage'.

*High Dynamic Range*
        * OpenEXR (http://www.openexr.com/) offers libraries and some
          programs to work with the EXR HDR format.

        * PFSTools (http://pfstools.sourceforge.net/) create, modify,
          and tonemap high-dynamic range images.

*Libraries*
        * LibJPEG (http://www.ijg.org/) is a library for handling the
          JPEG (JFIF) image format.

        * LibPNG (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) is a
          library that handles the Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
          image format.

        * LibTIFF (http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/) offers a
          library and utility programs to manipulate the ubiquitous
          Tagged Image File Format, TIFF.

          The nifty `tiffinfo' command quickly inquires the properties
          of TIFF files.

*Meta-Data Handling*
        * EXIFTool (http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/)
          reads and writes EXIF meta data.  In particular it copies
          meta data from one image to another.

        * LittleCMS (http://www.littlecms.com/) is the color management
          library used by Hugin, DCRaw, UFRaw, Enblend, and Enfuse.  It
          supplies some binaries, too.  `tifficc', an ICC color profile
          applier, is of particular interest.

Appendix A Bug Reports
**********************

     Most of this appendix was taken from the
     Octave (http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) documentation.

Bug reports play an important role in making Enblend and Enfuse
reliable and enjoyable.

   When you encounter a problem, the first thing to do is to see if it
is already known.  On the package's SourceForge homepage
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/enblend/) click "Develop" and on the
development page click "Tracker".  Search the trackers for your
particular problem.  If it is not known, then you should report the
problem.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that makes it possible to fix the bug.

A.1 Have You Really Found a Bug?
================================

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If Enblend or Enfuse get a fatal signal, for any options or input
     images, that is a bug.

   * If Enblend or Enfuse produce incorrect results, for any input
     whatever, that is a bug.

   * If Enblend or Enfuse produce an error message for valid input,
     that is a bug.

   * If Enblend or Enfuse do not produce an error message for invalid
     input, that is a bug.

A.2 How to Report Bugs
======================

The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this: report
all the facts.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or leave it
out, state it.  Often people omit facts because they think they know
what causes the problem and they conclude that some details do not
matter.  Play it safe and give a specific, complete example.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable someone to
fix the bug if it is not known.  Always write your bug reports on the
assumption that the bug is not known.

   Try to make your bug report self-contained.  If we have to ask you
for more information, it is best if you include all the previous
information in your response, as well as the information that was
missing.

To enable someone to investigate the bug, you should include all these
things:

   * The exact version and configuration of Enblend or Enfuse.  You can
     get this by running it with the options `--version' and
     `--verbose'.

   * A complete set of input images that will reproduce the bug.  Strive
     for a minimal set of _small_(1) images.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and its version number.

   * A complete list of any modifications you have made to the source.
     Be precise about these changes.  Show a `diff' for them.

   * Details of any other deviations from the standard procedure for
     installing Enblend and Enfuse.

   * The _exact command line_ you use to call Enblend or Enfuse, which
     then triggers the bug.

     Examples:

              ~/local/bin/enblend -v \
                  --fine-mask \
                  --optimizer-weights=3:2 --mask-vectorize=12.5% \
                  image-1.png image-2.png

     or:

              /local/bin/enfuse \
                  --verbose \
                  --exposure-weight=0 --saturation-weight=0 --entropy-weight=1 \
                  --gray-projector=l-star \
                  --entropy-cutoff=1.667% \
                  layer-01.ppm layer-02.ppm layer-03.ppm

     If you call Enblend or Enfuse from within a GUI like, for example,
     Hugin (http://hugin.sourceforge.net/) or KImageFuser
     (http://panorama.dyndns.org/index.php?lang=en&subject=KImageFuser&texttag=KImagefuser)
     by HARRY VAN DER WOLF, copy&paste or write down the command line
     that launches Enblend or Enfuse.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "The application gets a fatal signal," or,
     "The output image contains black holes."

     Of course, if the bug is that the application gets a fatal signal,
     then one cannot miss it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we
     might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.

A.3 Sending Patches for Enblend or Enfuse
=========================================

If you would like to write bug fixes or improvements for Enblend or
Enfuse, that is very helpful.  When you send your changes, please
follow these guidelines to avoid causing extra work for us in studying
the patches.  If you do not follow these guidelines, your information
might still be useful, but using it will take extra work.

   * Send an explanation with your changes of what problem they fix or
     what improvement they bring about.  For a bug fix, just include a
     copy of the bug report, and explain why the change fixes the bug.

   * Always include a proper bug report for the problem you think you
     have fixed.  We need to convince ourselves that the change is
     right before installing it.  Even if it is right, we might have
     trouble judging it if we do not have a way to reproduce the
     problem.

   * Include all the comments that are appropriate to help people
     reading the source in the future understand why this change was
     needed.

   * Do not mix together changes made for different reasons.  Send them
     individually.

     If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we might not
     want to install them both.  We might want to install just one.

   * Use the version control system to make your diffs.  Prefer the
     unified diff (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format)
     format: `hg diff --unified 4'.

   * You can increase the probability that your patch gets applied by
     basing it on a recent revision of the sources.

Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.
