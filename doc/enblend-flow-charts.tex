  Program Flow And Option Settings}

\genidx{program flow!internal}\figureName~\ref{fig:internal-enblend-flow} depicts \App's
internal work flow and shows what option influences which part.  \App{} works incrementally.
Thus, no matter whether starting with the first image or the result of blending any previous
images, it loads the next image.  After blending it the result again is a single image, which
serves as base for the next input image, this is the next iteration.

    \caption[Internal work flow]{\label{fig:internal-enblend-flow}\App's internal work flow for
      the ``next'' image.  The defaults are indicated like \sample{[default]}.  The Optimizer
      Chain is complicated enough to warrant its own chart in
      \figureName~\ref{fig:internal-optimizer-chain}.}

\begin{geeknote}
  \figureName~\ref{fig:internal-enblend-flow} somewhat simplifies the program flow.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The Graph Cut algorithm needs an initial ``guess'' of the seam line.  It gets it by running
    a Nearest-Feature Transform.

  \item
    If the overlap between the previous image and the next image is too small, the ``Scale down
    mask'' step is skipped and \App{} works with the mask in its original size (``fine mask'')
    no matter what the command-line options specify.
  \end{itemize}

      Chain of \figureName~\ref{fig:internal-enblend-flow}.}
