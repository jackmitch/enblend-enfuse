  \genidx{requirements!image}}

All input images for \App{} must comply with the following
requirements.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The images overlap.

\item
  The images agree on their number of bits-per-channel, i.e., their
  ``depth'':
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \code{uint8},
  \item
    \code{uint16},
  \item
    \code{float},
  \item
    etc.
  \end{itemize}

  See option~\option{--depth} below for an explanation of different
  (output) depths.

\item
  \App{} understands the images' filename extensions as well as their
  file formats.

  You can check the supported extensions and formats by calling \App{}
  with option~\option{--show-image-formats}.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, there are some good practices, which are not enforced by the
application, but almost certainly deliver superior results.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Either all files lack an \acronym{ICC} profile, or all images are
  supplied with the \emph{same} \acronym{ICC} profile.

\item
  If the images' meta-data contains resolution information
  (``\acronym{DPI}''), it is the same for all pictures.
\end{itemize}
